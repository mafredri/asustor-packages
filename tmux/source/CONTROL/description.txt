tmux - terminal multiplexer

Tmux is a "terminal multiplexer", it enables a number of terminals (or windows)
to be accessed and controlled from a single terminal. tmux is intended to be a
simple, modern, BSD-licensed alternative to programs such as GNU screen.

What is a terminal multiplexer? It lets you switch easily between several
programs in one terminal, detach them (they keep running in the background) and
reattach them to a different terminal.
