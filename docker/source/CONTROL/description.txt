Docker Community Edition (CE)

Docker Community Edition (CE) is ideal for developers and small teams looking to get started with Docker and experimenting with container-based apps. Available for many popular infrastructure platforms like desktop, cloud and open source operating systems, Docker CE provides an installer for a simple and quick install so you can start developing immediately. Docker CE is integrated and optimized to the infrastructure so you can maintain a native app experience while getting started with Docker. Build the first container, share with team members and automate the dev pipeline, all with Docker Community Edition.
